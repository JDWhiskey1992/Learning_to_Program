To change the username, make sure that the Raspberry Pi is setup to boot into Console Text console. Boot up the Raspberry Pi and login with the usual username and password. Enter the following:

exec sudo -s
cd /
usermod -l newname -d /home/newname -m oldname
sudo shutdown -r now

To change the password, enter passwd on the command line and hit enter. There will be a prompt to enter the current password, and then asked for a new password.
